### Open Data Source

#### [Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India](https://data.gov.in/)
The rationale behind open government data can be considered as twofold. First, advocates contend that making government data available to the public in open formats increases government transparency and accountability. Second, open data should enable third parties to leverage the potential of government data through the development of applications and services that address public and private demands.

### Data Visualization Tools

#### [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) 
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

#### [NVD3.js](http://nvd3.org/)

This project is an attempt to build re-usable charts and chart components for d3.js without taking away the power that d3.js gives you.
