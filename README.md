#### [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) 
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

#### [NVD3.js](http://nvd3.org/)

This project is an attempt to build re-usable charts and chart components for d3.js without taking away the power that d3.js gives you.
